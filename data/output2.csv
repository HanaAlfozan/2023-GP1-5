The oldest known form of the game is shown in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (circa 2686-2613 BCE). Many pictures of the game and artifacts have been discovered and are displayed in Museums around the world. The commonness of these finds indicates that the game was very popular in its time.\n\nThe main adversaries in Senet are the Spools and the Pyramids. These pawns follow a path from their start positions to the House of Horus in an inverted 'S'. The player moving all of his pawns off the board first wins. Fields on the Senet board are called houses. Some of these have special significance and are adorned with icons like the Ankh symbol. Instead of dice flattened sticks are used. Each stick has a bright side and a dark side. Every bright side is a point. If only dark sides are showing the player is awarded 5 points. When a 1, 4, or 5 is thrown the player gets another turn.\n\nWhen moving into a field occupied by an opponent, the pieces switch places. If, however, the opponent's pawn is part of a row of two or more, it cannot be beaten. It is possible to 'jump' over an opponent if it isn't part of a row of 3 pieces or more. 3 pieces are considered a block and are an important strategic tool.\n\nThrough symbology Senet hints at the afterlife as seen from an Egyptian point of view. If one's piece is beaten on one of the last three fields or the jump over the House of Water is not successful one moves back to the house of Rebirth. In such the game alludes to reincarnation and the journey of the dead.\n\nSenet Deluxe is a truly unique strategy game. It features great animation, a soundtrack, an intelligent adversary, enforceable backwards moves, highlighting for acceptable moves, game statistics and online help. Be prepared to spend many hours with the most popular game of the antiquity.\n\nFor more screenshots and several videos of the application in action, please visit the website indicated below.""",RoGame Software,4+,33.08,"Games, Strategy, Board, Education",2008-07-18,"['Others', 'Dutch', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Chinese (Simplified)', 'Spanish', 'Swedish']"

It's not about the war game or any other shooter games, its literally about painting the ball. There is a given pattern of colored balls and some pipes around them. You are given an amount of paint color to draw and change the color of any of the balls in the scene trying to match 3, 4 or 5 balls near a pipe, this way the pipes suck these matched balls and new paint is given to you. The gameplay is very different from the well known and cloned match 3 swapping candy fluffy games like candy crush soda and candy crush saga games. Try it and you'll get hooked.\n\n\u2022 Game Objective:\nYou have to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same color. These groups must be made next to a pipe. Paint balls by tapping on them. When you click on the ball you wish to paint, the ball changes color and the group gets sucked into the pipe.\n\n\u2022 Tips:\nUsing the same pipe makes it hot. If a pipe becomes extra hot the balls are transformed into multi-color which gives you extra points & life. Letters appear on some balls. When balls are grouped, the letter taken, complete the word 'PaintBall' on the bottom. When all word is completed a big bonus is earned!\n\n\u2022 Hard: The Hard game works exactly like the Easy game, but you have to play fast because your paint reserve is dripping! If it runs out, you lose.\n\u2022 Panic: In Panic mode you have 100 sec. to score as much as possible. This is not all! Your paint reserve is dripping & there are no black balls. This makes it easier to make groups.\n\u2022 Heat: In this mode, ball groups are taken only when they are next to a hot (red) pipe. Each time this happens active (red) pipes are moved. There are no black balls, which makes it easier to make groups. This mode needs planning!\n\u2022 Chroma: In the Chroma mode you will have to play using color combinations e.g.: if you have yellow paint & the ball you want to paint is blue. Blue and yellow will be: Green. Use the color wheel to keep track. If you mix opposite colors you get black.\n\nFEATURES\n* award winning gameplay\n* hours of gameplay craziness - mania guaranteed\n* many modes to play\n* fast playing ideal for waiting rooms/buses\n* Export Hi-Scores to internet\n* change ball styles\n\nPRESS:\n-----\nUIQ 2008 Open Winner for the games category! \n-----\ngamefreaks365: So, do you need Paintball 2?

When one stone lands on another of the same color, this stone as well as all bordering stones of the same color disappear. The goal is, of course, to empty the field \u2013 so far, so good.  \n\nYet, this simple concept leads to surprisingly challenging functions, and the variety of strategic possibilities make Pebbles an absorbing game. \n\nA shelf above the playing field shows which stone is going to come next. Knowing which stone is going to follow is a deciding factor in the game\u2019s strategy. \n\nChoosing the sequence of the moves with care is also very important: a well positioned pebble can do more than just eliminate others; it can also be the basis for up coming moves, just as a badly positioned pebble can prove to be terribly obstructive.  \n\nThe level of difficulty increases with the number of pebbles that are in the playing field at the start of a game as well as the number of different colors.",Objective Development,4+,9.67,"Games, Strategy, Board, Entertainment",2009-04-28,"['English', 'German']"

You can purchase upgrade modules via in App Purchase.\n\n(C) 1986-2011,\nRolf-Dieter Klein, Martin Ulrich,\nMunich, Bremen, Germany\n\nPorts of Call has a long tradition \nthe first version was released\non the Amiga 1986 with other versions\nfollowing.\n\nNow the classic game is getting mobil.\nWe kept the classic interface and design by intention, as this was a user request since years - an update for full screen support will follow soon, also other versions are on our wish and todo list.\n\nA Background on Tramp Shipping:\n\nThe traffic of goods by sea is organized \nin accordance with international agreements and contracts between individual countries. \nAbout 80% of the goods (called ""cargo volume"") transported between two countries is handled by ships registered under the flags of the countries concerned. The remaining 20% are \nopen to the free competition of ships under other flags. These ships, called ""tramp"" ships, are usually prepared to transport all kinds of goods. This aspect of the shipping business is the focus of Ports of Call.\n\nThe Object of the Game\n\nEach player founds his own shipping \ncompany, with a starting capital of $4.6 million to buy ships. Freight and ports of call can be chosen continuously from offers on the market.\nThen the captain chooses an economic travelling speed and casts off to encounter many adventures on the high seas.\n\nAfter unloading his cargo, the captain \nis credited with the agreed payment.\nThen he may refuel, make necessary repairs, and so on. The next job is to find a new, lucrative cargo, buy further ships, and/or repay his mortgages; in other words, he must have a more productive company than his competitors.\n\nA player\'s chances of success improve \nthe more he knows about international \nshipping. All data for the game originated from actual developments in the maritime world: the fluctuation of freight rates, refueling costs, port charges, and ship operating costs.\n\nBut the game is not a pure economic game, \nalso a ship simulator is integrated, and\nthe captain can steer his ship manually,\neither if necessary, or to save money and\nget a good status.\n\nIn summary, Ports of Call has been developed with this motto in mind: \n""Software with Hard Facts.""\n\n\nlatest hints: start using preowned ships, and keep them in good condition to avoid disasters (like rats for example).\nTo avoid the burglar, visit your office in a regular interval.  \n\n\nhomepage: www.portsofcall.de\nsupport: www.rdkleinforum.de",Dipl.-Ing.

Click \u201c\u2026More\u201d to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n\nTop #8 Game for iPhone 4G (ezinearticles.com)\n\nThe ultimate mind exercise and amusement comes up in a single iPhone application \u2013 WORP (techpeck.com)\n\n\nA profitable gift of concentration for all that love challenge (Carsten Scheibe \u2013 allemeineapps.de)\n\nI hate Solitaire, but this game is really fun to play (bitsundso.de)\n\n\nThis is really fun\n\u201cThe current version runs without problems, the menu is easy to use and totally understandable. The rules are very well explained and the tutorial is short and easy to understand. The game offers both diverting relaxation for small pauses or for bridging a gap between appointments and real challenges for combination skills in the higher levels. Conclusion: real fun!\u201d\n\u2013 obstfreund\n\nGreat little Brain Burner\n\u201eIf you enjoy a good puzzler, WORP is for you. I think the instructions could be a bit clearer, but a game or two will make things click. Very groovy ambient techno soundtrack. Well worth the dough they are asking for it.\u201c\n\u2013 Ortho123\n\nYour brow is furrowed in concentration. So far, you\u2019ve only managed to turn some of the primary bits into combined bits. That\u2019s what they call the playing pieces in this game \u2013 bits. Yet you have already eliminated quite a few from the board , but you still have a ways to go to get down to just one bit and release the game\u2019s next memory.\n\nThis is more than a mere brain teaser, WORP requires you to really stretch your intellect. The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time. The WORP app challenges you to intuitively learn the code for subtractive color synthesis while enjoying the electronic sounds of Konsorten\u2122. Don\u2019t let the fancy talk scare you off. You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck.\n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP has to offer.\n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once. This application has three difficulty levels and nine different memories, which increase in difficulty as they go.\n\nIf you need to take a little break because your brain is overheating, WORP lets you save your game and come back to where you left off.\n\nWORP provides the atmospheric sounds that complete the experience for you. You are going to be totally immersed in this game.\n\nFeatures\n- 9 different memories of increasing difficulty\n- 3 difficulty levels \u2013 beginner, intermediate and advanced \u2013 for each of the 9 memories\n- Atmospheric sound design by Konsorten\u2122\n- Interrupt any time via the Home button \u2013 resume where you left off\n- Undo all moves even after resuming a game\n- Game center integration (Leaderboards + Achievements)\n\nShow yourself what you and your brain can do. Download WORP now and start exercising your grey matter.

If you run out of mana, you cannot cast any more spells and your tower will be in danger. \n\n- Chain lightning damage - you can increase your damage of this spell to greater heights.\n\n- Hellfire - a fire from the hell that will burn your enemies to ashes.

Very few, unless you\u2019re talking about DodgeDot\u2122! What on earth can make a game so simple, yet so compelling and addictive? Why is the DodgeDot\u2122 player community so fanatic and dedicated?\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is truly a game for everybody with players around the world from 2 years old to in their nineties. With over 22 miliion games played to date, it\u2019s incredibly simple to play. DodgeDot\u2122\u2019s basic rules can be described in less than a minute and many players learn the basics just by jumping in and quickly discovering them by trial and error. It\'s a game that can be played at a gentle and relaxing pace and yet also provides plenty of challenges for players that want to develop their dexterity, playing strategy, and overall game skills for competition. \nDodgeDot\u2122 is elegantly simple, yet produces infinitely rich gameplay:\n\n- Drag the moving colored dots to matching goals to score points\n- Clear all moving dots from field to advance to the next level\n- Avoid colliding with dots of different colors\n- Avoid contacting unmatched goals of different colors\n- Join dots of the same color to earn bonus points\n\nThe nature of the game\'s dynamics are infinitely variable, with its dots moving in different directions and speeds, and with time and every player interaction affecting the subsequent dot movement patterns and point values.\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is also a visually pleasing game of colors.  Choose your favorite four-color schemes to play with, from a large selection of palettes.\n\n- New Game Rounds with fresh starting patterns for Levels automatically start every Monday!\n\n- Built in leaderboard network where you can have your own profile, see rank listings for players, friend other players,etc.\n\n- All registered Jampaq Network players have an opportunity to compete for fresh rankings every week!\n\n- Supports Apple\'s Game Center for high score leaderboard!\n \n- This is a universal application, so buy it for iPhone/iPod Touch and you can also install it on your iPad!\n\n*** WAS FEATURED ON Apple\'s ""WHAT\'S HOT"" LIST! ***\n\nDON\'T FORGET TO JOIN THE JAMPAQ NETWORK!\nREGISTRATION\'S FREE & SIMPLE IN-APP!\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nWatch videos at: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/dodgedot \n\nHere\u2019s what DodgeDot\u2122 players have to say:\n\n\u201cTotal Addiction!!!!  It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\'t stop playing.  ""\n\n""Excellent game.

The swarmers have decimated the entire fleet of warships leaving the inhabited planets and remaining spaces stations defenseless. \n\nHaving been on an extensive intelligence mission, your ship is the last of the fleet. You have been ordered back to defend what is left and drive the swarmers back. \n\nYour ship, the first of its kind, is faster and more powerful that those in the destroyed fleet and so you stand a chance of victory if you can master the swarmer\'s tactics.

It\'s up to you to save the galaxy.\n\nTo successfully complete you mission you must destroy all swarmers and protect at least two (2) space stations and two (2) planets from destruction without yourself being destroyed. Your ship is destroyed if the energy level or life support levels reach zero. \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nGalaxy Trek is a turn-based strategy game, similar in concept to the old mainframe trek game.

You maneuver your ship across the galaxy, destroying swarmers before they can destroy inhabited planets and space stations. \n\nThe game is played turn-by-turn. That is, you play your turn in which you can complete a set of actions, then the swarmers have their turn in which their ships will perform a countering set of actions. This continues until one side is victorious.\n\nYou will be ranked on your performance throughout the mission.\n\nFeatures:\n--------------------\n- Three levels of difficulty.\n\n- Your game is saved when you exit so you can pick up where you left off.\n\n- Highest score is kept.\n\n- Can turn on/off features in the Settings console.\n\n- iPod music can play in the background.\n\n- Complete instructions with illustrations are available in the game - no need for a wireless connection to access them.

For 20 years, the Earth has been under the rule of the Global Confederation that united and brought under its control all the countries and continents.   The mankind entered a new era. Global territory wars that had been waged for a century subsided. The world economy no longer supported the military machine to be ready for action and turned towards the progress. The new scientific horizons on the Earth and in outer space were open. \n\nBut peace and quite in the Confederation is being increasingly disturbed by the outbreaks of rebellions of those who oppose the Senat's policies. The resistance movement is gaining momentum all over the world. The Senate throws the whole reserve of Condederation's scarce peace-keeping forces to suppress the rebellion.\n\nIn the east of Peru, near the city of Pucallpa, some signs of rebellious activity have been observed. Prior to that moment, South America was the calmest of regions. Your mission is to crush the revolt in Peru and to capture the leader of the rebellion.\n\nYou are charged with a mission on which the future of mankind depends. As a general of Confederation you are to suppress a revolt in Peru.\n\nTo attain the goal you must complete 7 missions of the campaign on diverse terrains from the Amazonian jungle to the mountain ranges of the Andes. The game features a variety of machinery, facilities and upgrades. Each side has unique equipment with its features and fighting qualities and so its own tactics. Dynamism of this game won't leave you bored through the campaign.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle Plus is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. To try before you buy, see our free, ad-supported Pinochle app. If you prefer, our other pinochle app with no advertising, Pinochle Gold, has more card backs and tabletops to choose from, and adds support for several languages.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points.

Please see below for directions.\n\nOptia is a beautiful, immersive physics game about reflected light. You must activate all targets in each level with a laser beam, powering the transition to the next.\n\nFortunately, your puzzle-solving instincts come in handy here! Using a clever assortment of mirrors, you can reflect a beam in any direction, split it into two separate beams (or four, or eight, or sixteen...), and if you must, sacrifice your own laser to clear a path to that last target.\n\nAnd Optia doesn't end there! After cutting your teeth on the main campaign, you can create your own levels and upload them for others to play.\n\nWith 100 main levels, more than one thousand user-created levels, and a polished ecosystem for creating, playing, and rating new levels, you never really need to stop playing Optia. And you can decide if that's a good thing.\n\n- Featured in Apple's New & Noteworthy\n- Winner of Applied Arts Magazine Award for Game Design\n\n----------------\n\nTIPS & TRICKS\n\n- To sync levels across devices, unlock the level editor by completing 30 levels.

Also available in the App Store is a paid version with NO advertising: Pinochle Gold.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score.

The matriarch is dying, and murder is in the air - whoever survives this night will walk away with a fortune!\n\nIn this nasty, conniving, and thoroughly awful multiplayer strategy game, players take on the role of one of the four nobles trying to kill off the others.  Each noble is surrounded by a retinue of leeches, hangers-ons, and sycophants who can be bent to your will through the use of blackmail, flattery, or intimidation.\n\nYour goal is to gain influence over these subordinates, give one of them a weapon, and send them over amidst your opponents.  If you have enough influence over the subordinates, and they have a weapon, they\'ll kill that noble for you, and you\'re one corpse closer to winning the game!\n\nThe game is played in a turn-based fashion, using an innovative ""pass the phone"" style.  Each player takes a turn on the device, and then hands it to the next player to take their turn.  The device is handed around between players until one of them wins.  Audio cues triggered during play give other players clues as to what the current player might be doing, which adds to the intrigue.\n\nThis game may be played by 2 to 4 players, however, because it\'s all played on the same device, you only need one copy of the game to play with your friends.  The casual nature of the game makes it an excellent diversion to play while doing other things - hanging out, watching television, on road trips, waiting for the movie to start, etc.  It\'s a fun game to just pull out and run when you want something casual that engages your friends.\n\nThe original version of this game was created for the 2010 Global Game Jam by a team of 4 people.  This version is a cleaned-up and improved version with new features.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  *  Multiplayer casual strategy for 2-4 players.\n  *  Blackmail, flatter, and intimidate your subordinates to murder your rivals.\n  *  Fun, innovative gameplay that evokes Machiavellian intrigue.\n  *  Casual gameplay makes it ideal for parties, lunch breaks, or just when hanging out.",Barking Dog Interactive,12+,18.24,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy, Entertainment",2010-02-10,['English']

You may play against the computer, or play with one to three other friends or network players via Game Center.  Seats that are not filled by friends or network players are played by the computer.  With the multiplayer game, you may exchange group text messages and voice chats while in the game. \n\nEach player is dealt 13 tiles in a hand. The players take turns to draw a tile and discard one. The goal is to make 4 sets and 1 pair. You can win by drawing a new tile or claiming a discarded tile that completes the hand of 14 tiles. Hands formed must be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand. The default is 0 base point, but can be customized. \n\nIf the base point is set to greater than zero, an attempt to steal a discard that does not produce the minimum points to win will be preempted by another player\'s claim for pung, for example. Falsely declaring a win when the hand does not meet the base point will be penalized. The claim on a discard to form a hand with enough points to win has priority over other attempts to form kong, punt, or chow.\n\nRefer to wikipedia for a detailed description of the suite and scoring system of the game. \n\nAs few reviewers noted, this game offers realistic play. Drag the tile discarded by another player to your hand to claim it. Drag a tile out to discard it. If you draw a winning or kong tile, push multiple tiles forward to show your hand.    \nYou can move and rearrange the tiles at will.  To have them sorted automatically, do a hoizontal swipe above your hand.\n\nOn iPad, it supports layout on the larger screen in both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nA convenient feature, especially for single handheld play on the iPhone, is you can also click on the hand button to claim a tile or declare a win.\n\nYou can adjust the game speed and sound.  You can also control that hands be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand.\n\nChoose  ""Align discarded tiles"" to line discarded tiles neatly, else discarded tiles are spinned and placed randomly.\n\nYou can choose to play flower and season tiles.\n\nYou can change the the color of the background and tiles, or use a picture as the game background. \n\nMultitask switching on supported iOS. Game is paused when you switch away from the App and automatically resumed when you return. Resume button is still used to resume game saved if App is terminated (or for older iOS without multitask support).\n\nThe players bank will be shown at the start of the game.

When you play the more challenging level puzzles, it will give your brain a good stretch for hours, even days.  But when you complete the puzzle, you will feel like a genius with a fantastic sense of achievement and you're ready to move onto the next puzzle.\n\n\nLONPOS consists of 12 building blocks (known as Pentominoes), each unique in shape and color.  Each Pentomino can be rotated in 90\xb0 intervals or can be flipped in 180\xb0 to create a mirror image. Each puzzle revolves around a rectangular game board of 55 spaces. The goal is to place all Pentominoes into the game board to occupy all 55 spaces.  That sounds easy doesn\u2019t it?  Don\u2019t be fooled!

The rules are very well explained and the tutorial is short and easy to understand. The game offers both diverting relaxation for small pauses or for bridging a gap between appointments and real challenges for combination skills in the higher levels. Conclusion: real fun!\u201d\n\u2013 obstfreund\n\n\n\nGreat little Brain Burner\n\n\u201eIf you enjoy a good puzzler, Worp is for you. I think the instructions could be a bit clearer, but a game or two will make things click. Very groovy ambient techno soundtrack. Well worth the dough they are asking for it.\u201c\n\u2013 Ortho123\n\nYour brow is furrowed in concentration. So far, you\u2019ve only managed to turn some of the primary bits into combined bits. That\u2019s what they call the playing pieces in this game \u2013 bits. Yet you have already eliminated quite a few from the board , but you still have a ways to go to get down to just one bit and release the game\u2019s next memory. \n\nThis is more than a mere brain teaser, WORP HD requires you to really stretch your intellect. The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time. The WORP HD app challenges you to intuitively learn the code for subtractive color synthesis while enjoying the electronic sounds of Konsorten\u2122. Don\u2019t let the fancy talk scare you off. You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck. \n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP HD starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP HD has to offer. \n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once. This application has three difficulty levels and nine different memories, which increase in difficulty as they go.\n\nIf you need to take a little break because your brain is overheating, WORP HD lets you save your game and come back to where you left off.\n\nWORP HD provides the atmospheric sounds that complete the experience for you. You are going to be totally immersed in this game.\n\nFeatures\n- 9 different memories of increasing difficulty\n- 3 difficulty levels \u2013 beginner, intermediate and advanced \u2013 for each of the 9 memories\n- Atmospheric sound design by Konsorten\u2122\n- Interrupt any time via the Home button \u2013 resume where you left off\n- Undo all moves even after resuming a game\n\nShow yourself what you and your brain can do.

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.\n\nIn Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that's what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet.\n- Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon.\n- Destroyable 3D landscape.\n- Perspective or overhead view.\n- Three difficulty settings.\n- Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor.\n- Save / Resume game.\n\nNote: RESETgame does not condone invasion of other countries and cannot accept liability for such an event.""",RESETgame,12+,15.36,"Games, Action, Strategy",2010-04-01,['English']

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.\n\nIn Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that's what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet.\n- Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon.\n- Destroyable 3D landscape.\n- Perspective or overhead view.\n- Three difficulty settings.\n- Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor.\n- Save / Resume game.\n\nThis is the free Lite version with ads and limited supplies.

Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon.  Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.\n\nEarning its reputation as the thinking man's dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation.  Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.\n\nEach player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability.  Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.\n\nDepending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations).  More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief.  Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.\n\nUnlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon.  There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.\n\nOubliette is challenging, but forgiving.  New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters.  In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time!  Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips.  If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again.  The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.\n\nIf you are up to the challenge, Oubliette is free to download and play.  Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise.  And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels.

Rules are simple and intuitive enough for kids to play easily, yet there is more than enough strategic depth to satisfy the most demanding gamer. If you enjoy challenging games like Chess, Checkers, Go, or Shogi, discover Arimaa and see why it was chosen in the Discovery Channel's list of the Top 10 Mind-bending Strategy Games and also recommended by Scientific American MIND magazine.\n\n\u201cThe rules are simple enough for kids to learn, and the game was creative and engaging.\u201d \n\u2014Frederik Joelving; Scientific American Mind magazine\n\nWith millions of opening setups to choose from, every game requires creative thinking right from the beginning and no need to memorize openings. It's a never ending puzzle, each game is different. In just the first 10 moves of Arimaa there's more possible games than there are atoms in our universe.\n\n\u201cBecause the number of possible moves in an Arimaa position (roughly 20,000) is much higher than in chess (about 30 or so), even the fastest computers will not be able to search very far into the tree of possibilities.\u201d \n\u2014R. Wayne Schmittberger; GAMES magazine\n\nArimaa provides the whole family a chance to show the computer who's boss. Many games boast of the strength of their computer AI, but Arimaa requires a higher level of intelligence which humans possess and computers have yet to achieve. In fact Arimaa offers a $10,000 prize for anyone capable of writing an AI that can defeat the top human Arimaa players. Visit www.arimaa.com for more details.\n\nThis Arimaa app includes a video tutorial to teach the rules of the game making it easy to get started. There are increasing levels of difficulty to help you build your skill, and a score to let you know how well you played. Try beating the AI faster or by losing fewer pieces to top your high score.

'Peppers' is unlike any other match-three on the market today.  We took the match-three concept and raised it to the next level.  \n\nIf you enjoy games like, Bejeweled 2, Jewel Quest, Parking Lot, and Falling Gems, then you will love 'Peppers'.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Four game modes and eight ways to play.\n* Full Version has twenty unique levels.\n* Beautiful graphics and animation.\n* Stores top ten scores with statistics.\n* Jump to any unlocked level.\n* Listen to your own music or jam with ours. \n* Unlock achievement awards.\n* Uses the accelerometer.\n* Supports iOS 4 multitasking.\n* Battery friendly.\n\nHow to Play:\n\nIn each game, it's not just a race against time; one must score enough points in the current level to unlock the next level.  The time allotted for each level will remain the same; however, as each level gets harder the points necessary to unlock the next level will be reduced.  The game will end if the timer runs out and the next level has not been unlocked.\n\nLooking for game hints?  There are none!  Each game will begin with three pepper shakers which are displayed at the top of the screen.  As progress is made through the twenty unique levels the game will get more challenging.  Simply shake or touch the pepper shakers to randomly rearrange the peppers.  Since there are only three pepper shakers per game use them wisely because chances are they will be needed later on.\n\nIf no mores are possible one of three things will happen.  If the next level was unlocked then it will begin.  If not and there are still pepper shakers available then one will be used to continue, otherwise the game will end.\n\nOn Fire:\n\nUnlike traditional match-three games in which only two game pieces swap places, in 'Peppers' entire rows and columns are moved to match three or more peppers.  Once three or more matching peppers are lined up they, along with any adjacent peppers, will begin to shake.  \n\nContinue moving rows and columns to get as many peppers shaking.

In this captivating, dark Gothic puzzle-adventure, use Dr. Helsing's powerful torch and tonics to save the world from the demonic uprising!\n\nAWARDS AND ACCOLADES\nThis is no ordinary game! Helsing's Fire is recognized around the world as one of the App Store's premier puzzle games; full of charm and challenge.\n\n IGF 2011 - Best Mobile Game Finalist\n IGF 2011 - Excellence in Design Honorable Mention\n IGF 2011 - Excellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\n SlideToPlay - The 50 Best iPhone Games of 2010 (#7)\nTouchArcade - Best iPod Touch and iPhone Games (Puzzle)\n AppAdvice - The Very Best iPhone Games of 2010 (Puzzle)\n TheAppera - Best iPhone Games 2010\n TouchGen - Editor's Choice Awards (Puzzle Runner-up)\n\nPRESS QUOTES\n\nSlideToPlay\n... Helsing's Fire is one of those puzzle games that does something completely original and is unbelievably entertaining.\n\nEurogamer\n... With its insidious wit and gothic charm, Helsing's Fire is a joyously original instant classic that iPhone owners should buy immediately.\n\nTouchArcade\n... It's one of the most unique games I've ever played and is a true App Store gem. Surely only a creature of darkness would let this one slip by them.\n\nTheAppera\n... Helsing's Fire reinvents the puzzle yet again with some light and dark dynamics I guarantee you have NOT seen yet. Prepare to be enthralled!\n\nGamePro\n... This is a game that would absolutely only work on the iOS platform, and it's hands-down one of the best games on the App Store. It gets my highest recommendation.\n\nADDICTIVE PUZZLES\nHelsing's Fire features a brand-new puzzle mechanic never before seen: use the touch-screen to position Helsing's torch to illuminate different combinations of monsters, then destroy them in the correct order using Raffton's supply of different tonics. The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you'll always want to play 'just one more level'!\n\nA HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE\nWith puzzles set across four worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring fifteen different monster types including four bosses, Helsing's Fire provides an incredibly\nrich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!\n\nCOMPELLING SETTING\nThe Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing's Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it's clear that Helsing's Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.\n\nMULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nAs if the 120 distinct levels weren't enough, Helsing's Fire also comes with additional Endless Survival and Online Bounty modes, for the bravest of the brave! And when you've stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.\n\nDracula must be stopped. Raffton, take the tonics: it's time to head into the Blight!""",3909,4+,25.27,"Games, Strategy, Puzzle, Entertainment",2010-07-10,"['Chinese (Simplified)', 'English', 'Japanese']"

All of the warfare is carried out by enormous military robots.\nThe player controls a flying machine which can fly over any part of the play-area. The player must build robots and give them orders to attack Insignian robots and capture neutral or enemy factories to increase production and thus aid the war effort. The ultimate objective is to capture all the enemy bases and thus win the war. Everything takes place in real-time with the action being ongoing rather than turn-based. Because the player's view of the battlefield is limited to where their flying-machine is, much of the front-line fighting is left to the machines whilst the player concentrates on building more robots.

An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.\n\nThe application ""IQ Test: Calculate your IQ"" includes:\n\n*A free test of 10 questions :\nThis 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.\n\n*Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid)\nThe tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation.\nYou will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence.\nThis report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).\n\n*A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid)\nThe test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. \nIt will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension.\nThis test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist. \nIt includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\'s actual age right at the start of the test. \n\n*The IQ Expert challenge : (paid)\nThis test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110) \nThe ""expert"" version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests. \nThis IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests. \n\nHow to take this test:\n1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test. \nIt has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\nHi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\'m very satisfied with the results. I\'m really happy that I came off so intelligently! \nI feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides.

Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons - sneaky little blighters with a bad attitude!\n\nIn other words Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space.\n\nAs commander, it\'s your job to assemble your crack team of hedgehog soldiers and bring the war to your enemy.\n\nEach player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents\' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player\'s or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased). \n\n* Hilarious and devastating turn based combat for up to 8 players\n* Local multiplayer with optional AI opponents\n* Battle on an infinite number of randomly generated maps with over 31 environments, or choose from 48 set image maps\n* Utilise 55 (and counting) devastating weapons!

While pressing down firmly, slowly tilt the top of the pencil - beyond a critical angle the tip will suddenly slip away leaving a line drawn on the paper. This line determines your move or shot on the battlefield.\n\nLead Wars simulates this mechanic using the touch-screen as if you\'re touching the top of a real pencil.

You start out with quiescence of the elements, but you have to change faith to your advantage. You need a good strategy to break the quiescence \nto your advantage. But be careful, your opponent will try the same thing and you might end up loosing most of you Taijitu pieces that symbolize your faith. \n\n- Yin and Yang takes place between two players. The first player symbolizes the Yin, the second player symbolizes the Yang \n\n-It is played on an 8x8 board of 64 squares. There are 64 Taijitu pieces, colored black for player representing Yin and gold for the player representing Yang. \n\n- In the basic game, the board is set up initially with two Taijitu pieces for each player. The advanced games (Challenge and Master) have more pieces on the initial board) \n\n- Yang (black Taijitu) makes the first moved. Players are then taking alternate turns. \n\n- When making your move, you can change faith by forcing pieces on the board to change from Yin to Yang or Yang to Yin. \n\n- Goal of the game is, once all the pieces are placed to have more pieces than your opponent on the board. \n\n- At each turn a player must place a Taijitu piece with their color face up on one of the empty squares of the board, adjacent to an opponent's Taijitu piece, such that one or \nmore straight lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) are formed from the newly placed disc, through one or more of the opponent's discs and up to other Taijitu pieces of their own color already \non the board. All the intervening Taijitu pieces of the opponent's color are flipped to the faith (Yin/Yang) of the newly laid Taijitu piece. \n\n-Taijitu pieces may be flipped from one faith to the other but once played are not moved from one square to another or removed from the board. \n\n- Players may not pass unless there is no valid move available to them in which case they must pass. \n\n-Play continues until neither player is able to move, usually when all 64 squares have been played. \n\n- The player with most piece of their faith wins \n\n\nHistory \n\nIn Chinese philosophy, the concept of yin yang, normally \nreferred to in the West as yin and yang) is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other \nin turn. The concept lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of \ndifferent forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (tai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung) and of I Ching divination. Many natural dualities \u2014 e.g. dark and light, \nfemale and male, low and high, cold and hot \u2014 are thought of as manifestations of yin and yang (respectively). \nYin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly \nin particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. The concept of yin and yang is often symbolized by various forms of the Taijitu symbol, for which it is probably best known in western cultures. \nThere is a perception (especially in the West) that yin and yang correspond to good and evil (not respectively). However, Taoist philosophy generally discounts good/bad distinctions and other \ndichotomous moral judgments, in preference to the idea of balance. Confucianism (most notably the philosophy of D. Zhongshu, circa the second century BCE) did attach a moral dimension to the idea \nof yin and yang, but the modern sense of the term largely stems from Buddhist adaptations of Taoist philosophy. \n\n---------------------- \nThis game is enabled for GameCenter and allows you to play against other players through GameCenter.""",Uwe Meier,4+,23.72,"Games, Board, Strategy",2010-12-14,['English']

New pieces can only enter in contact with your own pieces.\n\nYou have a limited quantity of pieces, and they all move differently, so you have to think very carefully your move in order to use them wisely and outsmart your opponent!\n\nFinally, but most important of all: all pieces in the game should make one big group at all times, regardless of their owner. This rule can be used at your advantage to ""block"" your enemy\'s pieces and prevent them from moving.\n\nRule sets vary the amount of pieces players have and the way they move.",Raul Ignacio Verano,4+,39.06,"Games, Strategy, Board, Entertainment",2010-12-12,['English']

The players of the same team sit across from each other at a card table. Bridge consists of two parts: the auction, which determines the contract to fulfil, and the play, where the side that wins the bidding tries to take the tricks necessary to make their contract.\n \nOn Funbridge, you play South while North, East and West are played by the same artificial intelligence (AI) at all tables. So no need to wait until other players are available to play. The AI is available 24/7!\n\nOther players play the same deals as you. The aim is to achieve the best result. You enter rankings allowing you to compare your play to other players.\n\nFunbridge is designed for any type of players: from beginners (introductory module, lessons, exercises) to experts (tournaments). It also suits any player who wants to start playing bridge again (practice, challenges against friends).\n\nGame modes:\n- Get started with bridge: (re)discover the basics of bridge.\n- Series tournaments: perfect to see how you compare with players of your level.\n- Tournaments of the day: compare yourself to players from all around the world.\n- Practice deals: play deals at your own pace without stress.\n- Face the elites: pit yourself against top players from the Elite series.\n- Challenges: challenge any player in head-to-head tournaments.\n- Two-player game: practise with your favourite partner.\n- Team Championship: create your team and compete against teams from all over the world.\n- Federation tournaments: improve your federation ranking thanks to official tournaments held conjointly with bridge federations.\n- Funbridge Points tournaments: play these tournaments to enter the Funbridge Points rankings and compare yourself to all players.\n- Exclusive tournaments: create your own tournaments and discuss the deals you play.\n- Commented tournaments: get valuable advice from a bridge champion.\n\nYou can also:\n- Pause your deal or tournament\n- Watch a replay of other players\' moves\n- Replay deals that you have already played\n- Get the meaning of the bids made at the table\n- Seek advice from the AI in case of doubt\n- Set your bidding and card play conventions\n- Access an analysis of your play once the deal is over\n- Meet your friends and chat with them\n\nInternet connection required: the AI is not in the app, which is therefore much more efficient and we can continuously improve it without you having to update it.\n\nGENERAL TERMS OF USE, PRIVACY POLICY, SUBSCRIPTION, PRICES:\nThe Funbridge app offers a monthly subscription (1 month) and a yearly subscription (1 year).\nIf you subscribe in another currency, the price may vary slightly if your bank charges you a conversion fee.\nPayment for your subscription will be debited from your account after your purchase is confirmed.\nThe subscription is automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period.

It is a mobile game board for use on travel or at home. Searching for lost pieces is a thing of the past.\nOptionally Halma for iPad can validate the moves on the board. With move validation active the following restrictions are applied to moves:\n\n\u2022 Only moves or Jumps according to the rules are possible.\n\n\u2022 After a single field move no further move will be possible. If the move was an error you must use the undo button - that is the button with the blue arrow pointing to the left - to go back.\n\n\u2022 After a Jump only further Jumps will be possible. A single field move following a Jump will not be accepted.\n\n\u2022 After moving a piece of a certain color it will not be possible to move another piece of the same color. Note: This validation will not apply after one player has endet the game and End of Game recognition is on. Thus the other players are able to count how many moves are missing.\n\nFor games with three players there is an option for validating the play direction (clockwise or anticlockwise), which can be chosen by an agreement between the players before the game starts. The play direction is determined with the first move of the second player in the game, i.e. the second color in use. Note: This validation will not apply after one player has endet the game and End of Game recognition is on.\n\nMore Options:\n\n\u2022 End of Move recognition - automatic deselection of a piece if no further move is possible.\n\n\u2022 remember the game status when the application is suspended and restarted later.\n\n\u2022 End of Game recognition - bringing the last piece home is reflected by a tiny animation.\n\n\u2022 Soundeffects on or off\n\n\u2022 Display of the current time\n\n\u2022 Color selector for each player\n\nWhat this App is not:\n\nHalma for iPad is not a Computer Game in common sense. It does not act as an opponent and does not provide any artificial intelligence and therefore cannot be played by a single player.",Martin Buergel,4+,5.51,"Games, Board, Strategy",2011-01-13,"['English', 'German']"

He starts out with a difficulty of 2, but you can increase it to 3 if he isn't challenging you enough. This will slow Eugene down a bit, especially on devices older than iPhone 4.\n\nEugene isn't programmed with any pre-set openings. This makes for some interesting and non-traditional situations right from the start. Obviously, this also means that Eugene might get into trouble early since his vision isn't as deep as other engines that play by the book.\n\nEugene's brains are basically javascript, the language that powers the web. Apple continues to improve the performance of javascript with each new phone so Eugene will continue to get faster.\n\nAn actual rating of Eugene is a bit hard to calculate.

Word Assist was designed to help you improve your play, yet not do so much, that it takes away the excitement and challenge of the game. Word Assist frees you from the tedium of searching a long list of words, or guessing at random combinations of letters hoping for a valid word, and allows you to focus on the real strategy of the game.\n\nOn the Home screen of Word Assist, you can enter your letter tiles, then enter your search string, a maximum length for the word, and click a button to look for the search string at the start of the word, the end of the word, or anywhere in the middle of the word. Example, say your tiles are z,h,o,r,t,e,u and there is a word on your game board 'back'.  You could enter 'back' as the search term, with a max len of 15 and click In Middle, and you would get results such as 'backhoe' worth 19 points or 'outback' worth 18 points.  The results returned are all those words that can be made given the search term (tiles already on the board) and your own letter tiles.\n\nNow, Word Assist does not take into account Double or Triple Word or Letter square values.  This is where the player must employ their own strategy, and is what keeps the game fun to play.  A result that may have a lower word score may be more valuable if a high value tile falls on a Triple Letter square, so, it is up to the player to choose the best word from the list of results.  Why play the game at all if your App plays the game for you?\n\nHere are some other search terms that you could enter and what they mean:\n\nYour Tiles: d,a,e,n,r,i,r\n\nSearch term 'elude' with a max length of 15, clicking In Middle returns 'deluder', 'deluded', 'eluded', 'eluder'\n\nYou can also use an underscore to be a placeholder for any one of your tiles:\n\nSearch term 'v_i' with a max length of 8, clicking In Middle returns 'vainer', 'vein' etc.\n\nWord Assist also has a Lookup Screen (click the magnifying glass on the Home Screen navigation bar). The Lookup Screen searches the dictionary without any regard for the tiles that you have. So, it is a way for you to verify if a particular word you have in mind is in the dictionary or not. For example, if you were not sure if 'na' was a valid word, you could enter this in the search field on the Lookup Screen, click Search, and if the word is returned as a result, then it was found in the dictionary.  If no results were returned, it does not exist in the dictionary.\n\nYou may perform some advanced searches on the Lookup screen using 'wildcard' characters. So, similar to the way we used the underscore (_) character on the Home Screen to be a placeholder for any single character, you could enter 'f_z' in the Search field and click Search and the words 'fez' and 'fiz' will be returned. In effect, your wildcard search requested any three letter word starting with 'f' and ending with 'z'. \n\nYou can also use the wildcard character '%' to represent 'any number of characters'. So, if you entered '%z' in the Search Field and clicked Search, then you would get results such as 'razzamatazz' (worth 50 points!). Your wildcard search requested words of any length ending with the letter 'z'. \n\nYou may also combine wildcard characters. So, if you entered '__z%' in the Search field, and clicked Search, you would get 'razzamatazz' and 'zyzzyvas' since you requested words of any length, starting with any two letters followed by a 'z'. \n\nWord Assist eliminates the tedium of looking through long word lists for valid words, without taking away the fun and challenge of playing the game!""",Michael Dougan,4+,17.17,"Games, Word, Strategy, Utilities",2011-03-17,['English']

Think of a Butterfly like a King in Chess that is captured when it has pieces all around it.\n\nIn your turn you can either put a new piece in the board or move one of your existing ones. New pieces can only enter in contact with your own pieces.\n\nYou have a limited quantity of pieces, and they all move differently, so you have to think very carefully your move in order to use them wisely and outsmart your opponent!\n\nFinally, but most important of all: all pieces in the game should make one big group at all times, regardless of their owner. This rule can be used at your advantage to ""block"" your enemy\'s pieces and prevent them from moving.\n\nRule sets vary the amount of pieces players have and the way they move. \n\nThere are 10 rule-sets to choose from plus the ability to make your own!!!",Raul Ignacio Verano,4+,39.01,"Games, Strategy, Board, Lifestyle",2011-04-05,['English']

Immense amounts of strategy, replayability and detail. One of the few must have titles of strategy gamers\u201d\n\n(Ireland) \u201cThis is the first game that have regularly played online matches. While the mechanics are quite simple, you can really get yourself into to some interesting situations, especially when playing the campaign.\u201d\n\n(Australia) One night in Naarden.\nThis game is a blast. The campaign mode will have you on the edge of your seat, whether you\'re battling one of the top ten players or a newcomer. Mini matches are great fun, and the variety of armies and tactics is amazing. Even the AI is fun to play against, if you want to learn the game or perfect your strategies. Musket Smoke is a one of a kind game and will forever be in our hearts.""\n\n(Croatia) \u201cReal Strategy.

It controls everything I want to be on the touchscreen. Great work!\n- If you are like me, you are always having issues trying to remember what key you need to change something. This app makes it really easy to do some of the things you need most.\n- Makes it very flexible for us flight simmers rather than using the keyboard in the dark (night flights). Ipad is illuminated and you don't have to keep searching for keys.\n- Love it for eliminating one of my modified keyboards in my simpit. Since the iPad illuminates the keys no more fumbling. Mount it to your simpit desk and I guarantee you'll find it invaluable in no time flat.\n- This little app introduced new depth into my flight sim experience. Yes, I could have built a home cockpit a long time ago, had I had the required home. But since I move every 3 years this really is no option, yet. SKP-FSX does give my flight buddy and me the opportunity to share tasks when trying to land with zero visibility and sheering wind at 40 knots in northern Canada. It really helps a lot to be able to concentrate on steering and have someone operate the flaps and lower the gear for you, when you try to strafe the plane onto a 15m wide airstrip with an attack angle of 30 degrees. This app makes it possible, and runs like a charm, as does the server program on Windows.\n- Does most of the functions in FSX you commonly use your keyboard for. I find it so easy now to use all the autopilot settings, ATC, and view commands. Downloaded the server program for the PC and had it installed and running in three minutes.

Try to understand and interpret the hints you\'ll find during your exploration of the world to determine the exact location of the lair of the Dragon.\n\n...will you be able to hunt the Dragon?\n\nSome features:\n* virtually infinite worlds to explore. Each match is new and different;\n* different characters to select.

Like Sudoku, a number can only appear once in any row or column. Points are collected whenever a token is played, however points are only awarded when a row or column is completed by either player. All points collected by both players in a row or column containing a blocked cell are lost for scoring purposes.\n\nThe rules are simple but the strategies can become quite complex.\n\nThe basic game is available for free, but there are two additional capabilities available with an in-app purchase.

It is to take all the beans are in a certain house and place them in adjacent houses, one for home, when you do not stay up longer in the hands. If the seed does not end in the row where it began, it continues in another row, describing a circular motion counterclockwise. A seed goes to the right in the row nearest the player, and arrived at the end of the row, the row continues attacking from right to left, filling its main bowl (or barn).\nThe seed can be simple, ending with the last piece placed in a house already occupied by any other beans, or relay, which is exactly on finishing his bowl (or barn), this involves another round to earn extra.\n- Capture\nThe capture of beans, it happens if we happen after the sowing of beans a house with 0, in this case leads to arrest opponents of the bowl of beans opposite (front).\n\nThe aim of the game:\nThe goal is to finish the game with more beans in the bowl the main (or barn).\nThe game will end only when one player has reached the status of famine, it is achieved when there are no more houses in the beans, the beans and remaining opponents are automatically counted and moved into its main bowl.\n\nCreated specifically for the retinal display, there could be distortion devices without.",Paul Production,4+,10.32,"Games, Strategy, Board",2011-10-13,"['English', 'Italian']"

The genre has been done to death, sure, but take the bait and you\u2019ll find a new approach that\u2019s actually pretty darn brilliant.\n\nPLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE\n\n     So the aliens are attacking. Your job is to fortify key strategic locations in the solar system and repel the invading armies. This being deepest darkest space, however, there\u2019s a little thing called orbital gravity that you need to take into consideration.\n\n     Whatever your position - whether it\u2019s a planet or a space station or an asteroid - there are concentric rings around it, representing the gravitational field generated by the central mass of the object.\n\n     Into these fields of orbit you can slot satellites that will provide either defensive or offensive capabilities. But you can\u2019t just place these satellites anywhere. There are predetermined slots on each ring - for example, one at 12 o\u2019clock and another at 4 o\u2019clock.\n\n     When the aliens attack, they do so in waves from multiple directions, and with your satellites fixed in place you can swivel the ring around in a 360-degree circle to meet the threat.\n\n     The problem is that when fighting more than one wave at a time your offensive capabilities might be stretched too thin to provide adequate cover.\n\nFORBIDDEN PLANET\n\n     Even on the ordinary setting, Unstoppable Gorg is a formidable challenge. After several stages of hand-holding and tutorials, it\u2019s around about the fifth stage that you'll find themselves floundering a little bit.\n\n     There are modifiers called 'research tokens', which allow you to upgrade your satellites, and you might want to go back and replay earlier levels to harvest more of them. That\u2019s because they can be redeployed at the beginning of every stage - the more tokens you have, the more options you have when formulating a strategy.\n\n     Regardless of the difficulty, it\u2019s worth persevering, if only because this is a fine, fully realised real-time strategy title with excellent production values.\n\n     The sci-fi plot has plenty of surprises in store, including new allies to befriend and enemies to fight. If you can make it all the way through to the end you\u2019re truly one of the greatest armchair generals in the galaxy.\n\n     One last thing: Unstoppable Gorg is a port of a desktop computer game (currently available on Steam), but the iPad version lacks none of the features from its bigger counterpart. With the touchscreen interface as opposed to a mouse control scheme, this is probably the best - and best value - of the two.\n\nGOLD AWARD 9/10\n\nReview by Bulent Yusuf | 25 January 2012\nhttp://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Unstoppable+Gorg/review.asp?c=37229\n\n\nA quick word from Futuremark Games Studio:\n--- Problems on iPad 1?

The pieces and their moves will be familiar to anyone that has played standard chess, which makes this an ideal game for players of all skill levels. Certain spaces on the board allow pieces to make special moves, some of which are simply mind-blowing. Special visual effects and sounds enhance play. You can play locally with friends or challenge yourself against 3 levels of artificial intelligence. You can play alone or in teams of 2 vs. 2.\n \nIf you like chess or chess variants, you can hardly afford to miss out on Warlord Chess.\n \nBut I don\u2019t know 4 good chess players...\nDon\u2019t worry! Using the unique tabletop interface, you can select games with 2, 3, or 4 players in them. You can add computer/AI players as needed.\n \nMost importantly, because of the nature of the game, people of mixed skill levels can enjoy playing together. You don\u2019t need to be a chess star to have fun with Warlord Chess. In a 4-player free-for-all, the best player does not necessarily win!\n \nThat is a crazy looking board...\nThat\u2019s true! It needed to be to fit 4 full armies. Plus, it allowed us to add special spaces that make for some incredible moves.\n \nThe Chaos Symbol: the symbol in the center of the board gives a special move to Pawns, Kings, and Knights. If one of those pieces begins its move from one of the spaces touched by the symbol \u2013 then they can begin their move *from* any one of those spaces. This helps the Pawn and King a bit\u2026but it works wonders for the Knight. Don\u2019t believe us? Just look at the screenshots below!\n \nThe Castle: each player begins with their army surrounding their castle. A castle is made up of three spaces known as The Throne, the Great Hall, and the Courtyard. These spaces enhance the way the Bishop, Rook, and Queen move. Beware the Queen in the Courtyard!\n \nBut I\u2019m Just Learning/No Good at Chess/Easily Confused...\nThen we have the *perfect* chess game for you. The interface was designed for everyone. Just touch a piece to see all the moves it can possibly make. Then tap the space you want it to move to. If you don\u2019t like it you can Cancel that move and try another. When you are sure of your move, you can press a button to Confirm it.\n \nIf you need practice, play a local game against a single opponent and set the AI to Easy. Increase the difficulty and number of players as you get better. You can even play team games and learn from your partner. There are so many options!\n \nWhat Have You Got For Us Experienced Players?\nWe\u2019ve got a lot. If you are *very* familiar with chess, then Warlord Chess will provide you with a brand new challenge. It is nearly impossible to control a board this big, especially against 3 players who are out to get you. So good luck with that. You can set the AI to \u201cHard\u201d in order to play against opponents that can see multiple moves ahead.\n \nWe\u2019ve also provided you with tools for analyzing your Warlord Chess games. You can save and load up to five games. With our Rewind, Forward, Start, and End buttons you can move through those games step-by-step so you can figure out why you lost, brainstorm some killer new moves, or relive past glories.\n \nWhat Else Have You Got?\nWe\u2019ve got a board that hovers and rotates over a roaring field of flame. We\u2019ve got special attacks for each of the four colors in the game. We\u2019ve got Secret Passages and a cool scoring system. And we\u2019ve got more on the way.

The app now has a feature set that is, I believe, quite nice :-) for a free program.

Battle other players online controlling huge space fleets ranging from small fighters to gigantic battlecruisers. Play the single player campaign or train against the AI.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGalactic Conflict is a competitive SciFi RTS with a gameplay similar to Starcraft or Command & Conquer. You start out on your homeworld, build up your economy to gain valuable resources to research better technology and of course an impressive space fleet. Conquer new planets to expand your influence and increase your income and use your strategic thinking and perfect execution to ultimately defeat your opponents \u2013 either online or against the AI.\n\nGalactic Conflict was explicitly developed for tablets but brings real time strategy on a scale previously unseen on mobile devices. You can literally control hundreds of space ships at the same time. Ships come at all sizes: watch small fighters and corvettes dog-fighting for strikecraft supremacy, bombers swarming enemy ships, frigates hypering in to lay waste to an enemy planet or unleash the tremendous firepower of the huge capital ships.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN\n\nEnjoy the single player campaign where the Terran Confederation\u2019s home planet has been attacked by the mysterious Pyros race without prior notice. Only a small fleet of Terrans could survive the cowardly attack and they are now on the run. Join the terran space fleet in 12 immersive missions, help protect the only survivors of the human race and find the best strategies to repel the invaders.\n\nSKIRMISH AGAINST THE AI\n\nPlay against AI opponents in four different difficulty settings in numerous galaxies to shape up for multiplayer. Experiment with new strategies, learn your preferred race and work on your timings to outsmart the opponent.\n\nINTENSIVE MULTIPLAYER ACTION\n\nChallenge your friends in a 1v1 or 2v2 on Game Center or get automatically matched to other players on the Internet. Let\u2019s face it: nothing beats the excitement of playing real people. This opens up an infinite variety of strategies for endless replayability. Can you gain #1 on the Game Center leaderboards?\n\nGAME BALANCE\n\nGalactic Conflict features two distinct races each having 13 different space ships. It is easy to control on a touch device even for newcomers to strategy games but still provides good strategic depth for real-time strategy fans. We all know that in strategy games, the meta-game shifts as new strategies are discovered by innovative players and this needs continuous small adjustments to the gameplay often referred to as \u201cbalancing the game\u201d.\nThe game was made by experienced, passionate real-time strategy players and as such, we are dedicated to keep the game balanced for the best multiplayer experience.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nWe encourage you to leave feedback on the AppStore so other players know how awesome the game is. However, please note that we do not read AppStore reviews. If you want to contact us about the game, your view on balance or other suggestions, please send us a mail to support at bitmen-studios.com.

The rich camel hears him, meets him and finds out they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy, ""by Fortune and Fate"", in the course of seven amazing voyages... \n \nThe First Voyage - Sinbad sets to sea to find a fortune. After finding a lot of diamonds on different islands during his first voyage, he lands on an island that  proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale. After being awaken, the whale pulls Sinbad into the water.  Sinbad struggles to keep afloat and needs your help.  HINT: To help Sinbad come back safely home find the harpoon to  stay on whales back! \n \nThe Second Voyage - Sinbad is restless and sets to the sea again. He leaves his ship and finds himself stranded in an deep island valley populated by birds called Rocs and their just hatched eggs. The valley is also full of diamonds.   Merchants harvest these diamonds by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley which rolls down the steep  walls, picking up the diamonds as they roll to the bottom.  The Rocs pickup the meat rolled in diamonds and bring it back to their nests to feed their young.. Sinbad wants to use this to get out of the valley.  HINT: To help Sinbad become rescued, find a chunk of meat to strap on his back and get carried to the nest!\n \nThe Third Voyage - Adventure calls and Sinbad sets to sea for a third time. He finds himself on the island and captured by ""a huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of color, ... "" He needs a weapon to free himself from the creature.  HINT: To help Sinbad escape, find a sword to blind the creature with!\n \nThe Fourth Voyage - Sinbad sets sails again. He finds himself trapped in an underground cavern of one of the islands. He needs your help to escape.  HINT: Find a map to help Sinbad find a way out of the cavern!\n \nThe Fifth Voyage - Seized with the longing to travel, Sinbad starts his fifth journey. In this adventure, Sinbad is enslaved by the Old Man of the Sea, who rides on his shoulders with his legs twisted round Sinbad\'s neck and will not let go. The only way to free Sinbad is to distract the Old Man of the Sea.  HINT: Find a wine goblets to help Sinbad trick  the Old Man into drinking some and escape!\n \nThe Sixth Voyage - Yearning for another travel, Sinbad, on his sixth voyage, finds himself cast on a desolate river shore. In order to escape this desolate shore, Sinbad must leave the shore via raft.  HINT: Find a knife to help Sinbad construct a raft and float down the river to the nearest city.\n \nThe Seventh Voyage - The sea calls to Sinbad and he answers one more time. This time he gets set down on a mountain-top by bird-people existing on one of the islands. The only way off the mountain top is to scale down its steep cliffs.  HINT: To get Sinbad safely home find a rope to get him down of the mountain.\n\n*** Features***\n\nAmazing 3D graphics and 7 levels of play.\n3 different power ups: SKATEBOARD - to speed up Sinbad, HOURGLASS - to add time to finish the voyage and KEY to help you unlock parts of the maze if you can\'t find way out.\nRandomly generated maps, so each game is never the same.\nMultiplayer game mode for iPhone and iPad that allows you to play against people all over the world.\nUniversal game, works on iPhone, iPod and iPad.\n\n*** Transport yourself in the world of Sinbad, BECOME THE VOYAGER, download now! ***","Excel Heritage Group, Inc.",4+,18.89,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Racing",2012-02-03,['English']

THE ULTIMATE IPAD STRATEGY GAME : GENESIA LITE !\n\nThis new version of GENESIA is inspired from the game of the same name I created twenty years ago on Amiga 500. GENESIA, named Ultimate Domain in the USA, is a turn based strategic game that received the \xab Tilt d\u2019or \xbb in 1993 for the best strategic game facing the challengers of the time such as \xab Dune 2 \xbb and \xab Starlord \xbb. \n\n100% REWRITTEN WITH OPTIMIZED TOOLS FOR IPAD 2 \n\nGENESIA\u2019s programming has been entirely re-thought and re-written according to Objective C, whilst maintaining the philosophy and original title of the game.  \n\nA \xab BALLSY \xbb GAME DESIGNED FOR PLAYERS HARD TO PLEASE \n\nGENESIA is not an easy game. Contrary to \xab Gameplay \xbb where everything is pre-cooked and where your hand is being held to redirect you every two minutes, here there is no tutorial obligating you to do this or that in order to advance. \n\nIn GENESIA, there are no mind blowing special effects. I preferred to keep my focus on the deepness and interest of the game. \n\nAN \xab OLD FASHIONED \xbb GAME, WITH REAL \xab TURN BASED \xbb BITS IN THEM ! \n\nOne year is divided into four seasons and each season corresponds to one round in the game. In the beginning of each round, little time is given to you to elaborate your strategies and distribute your orders, before passing to your opponent\u2019s hand. \n\nYou can do what you want at any given moment whenever you feel the need to. Being quick or slow isn\u2019t a problem, at any given moment the situations can permute and a well played hand can change the unravelling of the round. A situation that seems completely hopeless to you can, armed with patience and strategy, turn around to your favor. \n\nTACTICAL COMBAT, MANAGEMENT, ADVENTURE AND \xab GEMS \xbb ! \n\nGENESIA isn\u2019t a simple race against time. You will always have several ways to do what must be done, and step by step, you will sharpen your tactics. To achieve victory, you will have to develop your economy\u2019s politics and accumulate resources that will enable you to recruit soldiers to find as fast as you can gems of NEORT. \n\nGENESIA \xab IT\u2019S ALIVE \xbb ! \n\nTo evolve in GENESIA, you will have to act as harmoniously as possible. Several crafts are at your disposal to build this New World : farmers, lumberjacks, blacksmiths, carpenters, soldiers... But all of this won\u2019t be done easily for other Governors are striving just as you, on other territories. It\u2019s your economy\u2019s development, your military force and technological advancement that will lead you to the term of your engagement. \n\nAs in every society, your people aspire to happiness and have their own lives.

As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package.\nHearts is trick-taking playing card game for 4 players, no teams and no trump suit. The game is also known as The Dirty, Black Lady, Chase the Lady, Crubs, and Black Maria, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is regarded as a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game. The object of the game is to avoid taking points. When the first player reaches 100 points, the player with the lowest number of points is the winner.\n\nIn hearts each heart card is worth 1 point and the queen of spades is worth 13 points, which is as much as all of the other cards combined.\nAt the beginning of round, the players choose three cards to pass to a random player. The player with the 2 of clubs must lead the first trick with the 2 of clubs. For each trick a player must follow suit unless he does not have a card of that suit. Because there is no trump, a player can not win a trick if he passes a card of any suit other than the suit lead. Hearts can not be lead until hearts are broken - after the first heart card has been played. If a player takes every point in a round, he \u201cShoots the Moon\u201d and he receives 0 points for the round while all other players receive 26 points.\n\nDon't forget to check our Games section for more fun games...""",GASP Mobile Games Inc,4+,9.71,"Games, Card, Strategy",2012-03-13,['English']

If you\'re not familiar with the rules of Mahjong Solitaire game, the this app is a good introduction, because this app is easy to play. The difficulty level of this app is for all levels, although most of the levels are for ""beginner"" to ""intermediate."" The easy levels (boards layout) are fairly simple, the stacks of tiles are short and the number of tiles to match are not overwhelming.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple:\n- You are presented with the game board, containing stacked tiles, forming structures such as the so-called ""pyramid"" or ""turtle"" solitaire board, tower-like stacks and others. \n- To win the game, all the tiles much be removed from the board by matching them.\n- Tiles can be matched if they have the same face/picture, under the condition that the tile is not blocked. \nA tile is not blocked if it can slide to the left, right, or both, and there\'s no tiles above it.\n- You lose the game when the board has not been cleared and there\'s no more tiles that can be moved.\n\nSounds simple? Then start playing. But prepare for some challenges, because Mahjong Solitaire is an easy to learn game that can be hard to master. You need to think ahead and chose which tiles to match carefully. Sometime the best move is the one that will free more matching tiles and not the most obvious ones. Sometime you\'ll just have to try your luck because the tile underneath the matching tile is blocked. \n\nAs mentioned, it can be challenging not to not end up with tile(s) that are not ""free,"" which cause the board to be in an unsolvable state (dead-end). This can occur when all the matching tiles are covered by other tiles or if they can\'t be moved because there\'s a tile blocking its sides or covering above it.\n\nFeatures:\n- Colorful Easter eggs themed variations of popular Solitaire Mahjong game. Instead of matching numbers and bamboos and dragons, you\'re matching pictures of painted Easter eggs.\n- Contains many boards for beginners and casual players alike.\n- The boards are for various Mahjongg skill levels, beginners to intermediate. The traditional/classic turtle/pyramid board tower is included. \n- Easy touch interface, just tap a tile then that another tile that matched it.\n- Hint option to highlight matching Mahjongg tiles (if there\'s a match possible).\n- Shuffle options to assist when reaching a dead end. This will ""free"" some of the previously blocked tiles. But use sparingly because the number of Shuffles is limited.\n- Cheerful graphics and soothing background music.\n- Every board (level) is generated with a special algorithm.

Chess Score Pad is designed to be easy to use because we know that you need to concentrate on your game.\n\nKeeping a score sheet is required for tournament games and essential in order to review your games to improve. A paper scoresheet distracts you from your game and they are prone to errors. Then the game needs to be manually copied into your chess game database. With Chess Score Pad there is no need to translate the move to the coordinates or risk forgetting to record a move. You simply drag or tap the piece to the new square. Then, after the game you can share the PGN file of the game and import it to your chess game database for analysis and review.\n\n* Designed and written by a chess player who has played hundreds of USCF rated games. \n* Game PGN can be shared using the standard iOS Sharing. This can include AirDrop, Message, Mail, Notes, Clipboard, Save to Files and direct import to apps that accept PGN (HIARCS). \n*Universal App for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad for one low price. \n*Quick and easy setup: \n   - You can start entering moves without entering any information about the game.\n   - The ""Next Game of Event"" action copies the event name and increments the round number.\n   - You only need to enter your opponents name and your name is automatically entered. \n   - You can select frequent opponents from your contacts. \n   - Your pieces are automatically placed at the bottom of the screen. \n\n* All moves are automatically saved. There is no chance of losing the moves you entered because you did not tap a save button. \n* Move entry by dragging OR tapping the piece. Both options are always available. \n* Straightforward move correction. \n* Review moves with single move buttons or the live position slider to quickly find critical positions for review after the game. You can also use a swipe gesture to review moves.\n* iPad users can display the notation while entering moves. \n* Options to check for legal moves and positions.\n* Adjust your screen brightness from the board view with swipe gestures. \n* Print a scoresheet with a position diagram to an AirPrint printer.\n* Option to include the time spent on each move in the scoresheet or PGN. \n* Localization for English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish. \n* Option for long (Ng1-e2) or short (Nge2) notation.\n* Option for Figurine algebraic notation or Standard algebraic notation (Nf3) .\n\nChess Score Pad is an electronic scoresheet to record your moves during a chess game.
