   Individuals are exposed to various content on multiple platforms such as social media and
video games. Concentrating on video games, majority of people play games as way of
entertainment, socialize, and a method to unwind. However, many of them have
trouble choosing games that are appropriate for their needs, particularly parents who are worried
about the games their children play. In most cases, the exposure to harmful content may lead
kids to risks such as in-game bullying, identity theft, credit card fraud, sexual exploitation.
Without the right guidance on what games are appropriate for them to play, kids are prone to one
of these risks. Therefore, we thought of building a system that helps find the appropriate games
for each user based on their age group.
   The following markup and programming languages are required to complete our project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and tools: Jira, GitHub, and the Django framework. 

Launching Instructions:

  1- Data Augmentation and Labeling: Begin by augmenting and labeling the facial images dataset.

  2- Model Training: Proceed to train several classification models using machine learning technology in Python. These models should be trained on the augmented facial images dataset.

  3- Face Detection and Age Group Classification: Train several models to detect users' image faces and categorize them into five different groups: toddlers (0-3), +4, +9, +12, and +17.

  4- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of all trained models, and select the one with the best results.

  5- Data PreProcessing: Preform preprocessing techniques to AppStore dataset such as data cleaning and encoding.
  
  6- Integration with AppStore Dataset: Integrate the chosen classification model with the AppStore dataset.

  7- Website Creation: Start working on website's interfaces and features such as filtering and sorting.

  8- Launch the System: In this step, the system will be launched after integrating the age group estimation model, the Appstore dataset and the created website. This system will display suitable games for each user, taking into account their age group and preferences.
